abstract="Deep learning has proven itself as a successful set of models for learning useful semantic representations of data. These, however, are mostly implicitly learned as part of a classification task. In this paper we propose the triplet network model, which aims to learn useful representations by distance comparisons. A similar model was defined by Wang et al. (2014), tailor made for learning a ranking for image information retrieval. Here we demonstrate using various datasets that our model learns a better representation than that of its immediate competitor, the Siamese network. We also discuss future possible usage as a framework for unsupervised learning.",

Intuitively, the sequences are warped in a nonlinear fashion to match each other. Originally, DTW has been used to compare different speech patterns in automatic speech recognition, see [170]. In fields such as data mining and information retrieval, DTW has been successfully applied to automatically cope with time deformations and different speeds associated with time-dependent data.",

    abstract = { A novel video-based finger writing virtual character recognition system (FVCRS) is described in this paper. With this FVCR system, one can enter characters into a computer by just using the movement of fingertip, without any additional device such as a keyboard or a digital pen. This provides a new wireless character-inputting method. A simple but effective background model is built for segmenting human-finger movements from cluttered background. A robust fingertip detection algorithm based on feature matching is given, and recognition of the finger-writing character is by a DTW-based classifier. Experiments show that the FVCRS can successfully recognize finger-writing uppercase and lowercase English alphabet with the accuracy of 95.3\% and 98.7\%, respectively. }

abstract="Vision based tracking systems for surveillance and motion capture rely on a set of cameras to sense the environment. The exact placement or configuration of these cameras can have a profound affect on the quality of tracking which is achievable. Although several factors contribute, occlusion due to moving objects within the scene itself is often the dominant source of tracking error. This work introduces a configuration quality metric based on the likelihood of dynamic occlusion. Since the exact geometry of occluders can not be known a priori, we use a probabilistic model of occlusion. This model is extensively evaluated experimentally using hundreds of different camera configurations and found to correlate very closely with the actual probability of feature occlusion.",
